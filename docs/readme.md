### What `Vanilla Configuration` means?

Like Vanilla JavaScript, **Vanilla Configuration** means that we are not using a script from any library or framework that configures our tools automatically for us. We are configuring them manually from scratch choosing our resources.

> ![VANILLA-JS](resources/vanillajs-button.png)  
> **Vanilla JavaScript** refers to using plain Javascript without any additional libraries or frameworks. The term became popular when Eric Wastl created the [Vanilla JS site](http://vanilla-js.com/) in 2012 as a joke. The site tries to bring attention to the fact that you can use just plain Javascript in many cases.

### and `Template`?

It's not really a template for building a web/JS app, but a template for configuring and testing the tools we use to build web apps.

## What else?

It is a set of documents that explains **how to configure the tools** that we use to create web/js apps.

### But, why?

It is a good way to learn how to configure all the tools that we use every day, but we don't know how they work. It is a lot of work, but it is worth it.

> And yes, it can be used as a starting point for building web/JS apps from scratch, without using any libraries or frameworks.

## See an example app developed using fender-vconf:

> Although fender-vconf is a work in progress, a version of it is currently being used in the candleBox-GI charting app.
