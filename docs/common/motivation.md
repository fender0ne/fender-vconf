It all started with the development of candlebox-GI, a candlestick charting library that we built from scratch, without using any libraries or frameworks. We wanted to learn how to do it and be able to customize it according to our needs.
The first step was to chose the tools and development environment, and configure them from scratch to work together.

We chose the following tools:

- Jest: for unit testing
- SAAS: for CSS
- Eslint: for code linting
- Prettier: for code formatting
- lint-staged: for running linters and formatters on git staged files
- Husky: for git hooks
- github actions: for continuous integration
- Local HTTPS web server: for development
- Debugging with vscode and Chrome

For that reason, the main gol for this project is to document all the configuration needed **from scratch**, and become aware of many of the tools that we use every day, but we don't know how they work.
