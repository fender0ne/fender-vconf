# Git, GitHub and Github Actions

We are using **git** with **LFS** for version control and **github.com** for the repository.  
Also we are using **github pages** to publish a demo of [`fender-vconf`](https://fender0ne.github.io/fender-vconf/).

> :notebook:
> git-lfs is a Git extension that improves how large files are handled. It replaces large files with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com
>
> :spiral_notepad: We do not need using git-lfs for our development, but we wanted to test it and included a gif and a jpg file in our readme file that use this system. For other images files we use google drive and for videos we use youtube.

> We are also using [`GitHub Actions`](https://docs.github.com/es/actions) to automate our development workflows.
