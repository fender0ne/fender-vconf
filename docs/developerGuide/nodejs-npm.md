# [`NodeJS & npm`](https://nodejs.org/en)

> **Node.js** and its **npm** package manager are the fundamental tools in the javascript development environment. These allow us to install and configure the others; They are not the only ones, we also have tools that can be installed in a standalone way and although we use them in a javascript environment, they have been written in other languages such as rust, dart, etc.

We must also have **node v^14.20.0** and **npm v^6.14.17** installed.

> :spiral_notepad:
> We are using the tool manager [`volta`](https://volta.sh/) to manage our node versions.

```bash
volta install node
```

> :spiral_notepad: Alternatives to npm: [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) (see limitation of using pnpm with volta).
