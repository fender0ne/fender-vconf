> A local **file server** configured to serve our app via the **https** protocol.

We have tried the following:

- [`live-server`](../configs/file-servers/live-server-node.md)
- VSCode [`Live-Server Extension`](../configs/file-servers/live-server-extension.md) and its [Live Server Web Extension ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/live-server-web-extension/fiegdmejfepffgpnejdinekhfieaogmj) for Chrome.
